[![http://x93.xanga.com/5cdc607428030205818346/z160028141.png][3]][3]It seems that some people always have an excuse. “I haven’t had a chance to sleep” “It’s too cold out” “The economy sucks right now” “Life is just too hard” etc… The New York Times is calling this phenomenon “Self Handicapping”. These excuses and beliefs can drag a person down significantly! I know we’re all guilty of this stuff from time to time, and it’s very easy to fall into the excuse trap, but it is just a trap.
