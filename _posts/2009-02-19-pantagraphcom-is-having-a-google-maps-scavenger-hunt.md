It looks like the [Google Street View car][2] took a detour through [Bloomington, IL][3], and it has caught the attention of the [local media][4]

Although Google only covered a few major roads, the local newspaper is encouraging readers to go out and look for people they know, and try to figure out when the car came through.

It’s kind of a cool idea to use Google Maps as a town-wide Scavenger Hunt.  I’d like to see how this turns out!
