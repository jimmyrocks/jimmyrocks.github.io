It looks like they’re keeping the bike lane, but otherwise, Broadway will become a pedestrian walk around the intersections with 7th and 6th Avenues.

They say this will increase traffic movement on both 7th and 6th avenues.  It looks like they’re removing parking from the one side of 7th Ave to put in another lane.  I’m all for this, because it reduces the chances of getting [doored][2] while biking down the road.
