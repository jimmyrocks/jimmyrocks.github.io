For people like me who can’t justify paying $50 /mo for cable, antenna TV is the only way to watch anything.  Luckily a lot of good stuff comes over antenna, but the gov wants to change that!  They have set a date to [change to all digital tv][3] by Feb 17, 2009, which now might get changed again, to some time in June or maybe even July.  This is good news to people like me who were slow on getting their [coupon for a converter box][4].  I was just planning on not watching TV anymore, [hulu.com][5] and the networks do a good job at providing it over the internet.
