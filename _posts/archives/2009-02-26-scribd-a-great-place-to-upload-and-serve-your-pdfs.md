Those of you who talk to me on a regular basis know that I love touting [Scribd][1] as the best new document sharing service.  They have a service called [iPaper][2] that lets you embed your documents anywhere.

I love Scribd for sharing documents that would otherwise sit on my hard drive unused.  By serving up documents that I created, I am able to share information with people and hopefully reduce the amount of research that people need to do.

On example of a document I uploaded is below.  I created a Powerpoint presentation for [GIS day][3] 2008 to help a group of students understand how Google Maps works with external data.  After the presentation, the document would just sit on my hard drive.  So I decided to upload it to Scribd to help out the growing [GIS community on Scribd][4].

Anyway, Scribd was nice enough to send me an Amazon.com gift card, so I feel I should officially promote them.  I don’t work for them or expect to be getting any more money, but I will definitely continue to use their service!
