It looks like D-Link is planning on releasing a 7″ Monitor completely powered by USB for < $100!  This could be very cool for presentations, watching movies on Hulu while participating in a chat session, or really anything you need to do while your other monitor is being used in full screen mode.

I would like it to have a touch screen too, because then it could be used as a control panel for all sorts of cool applications!
