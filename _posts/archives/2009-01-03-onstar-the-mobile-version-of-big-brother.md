So apparently if you have OnStar, and do something stupid, OnStar will call the cops right up and tell them to “help” you. Possibly to a free blood test!

From the [Morning Call][1]:

> *A 22-year-old Monroe County man whose OnStar navigation system sent an alarm when his vehicle got stuck in the mud got more help than he expected. 
> State police ended up giving him a ride — for a blood test.
> 
> Paul W. Sinker III of Stroudsburg was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol after two state troopers were dispatched to his vehicle through OnStar’s automatic crash response system.
> 
> A news release said the troopers from the Swiftwater barracks were sent to Rim Rock Road around 1 a.m. Thursday to investigate. They found Sinker attempting to free his vehicle after getting stuck in mud while turning around, state police said.  
> Troopers said while they talked to Sinker they smelled alcohol on his breath. After he failed a field sobriety test, they arrested him.
