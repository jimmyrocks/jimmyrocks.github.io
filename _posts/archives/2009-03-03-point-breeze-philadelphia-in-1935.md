[![][2]][2]This is an interesting look at the Great Depression, and its impact on the Railroad industry, Philadelphia, and the environment.  Anyone who has ever driven down[ route 291][2] to the Philadelphia Airport knows of the vast oil refineries, and the horrible smell that is associated.  It’s interesting to see just how many railroad cars sat there waiting to be used.
