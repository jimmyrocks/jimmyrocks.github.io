CNET reports that by 2012:

> All the major handset makers, including, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson, have agreed to use the Micro-USB technology as the common universal charging interface

Also from [the article][2]:

> All in all, it’s huge win for the planet and for me–the consumer. It’s such a no-brainer. It makes you wonder why no one thought of this sooner.

I believe this is because the companies could make tons of money by selling us a new $30 charger everytime we found ourselves away from home with no way to charge our phones.

Now if there was only a green way to get rid of my excess of old phone chargers.  Any ideas?
