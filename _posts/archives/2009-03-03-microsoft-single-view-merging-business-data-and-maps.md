![][1]It looks like even Microsoft is picking up on the current momentum of [Neogeography][2].  This product seems to be pretty similar to its already existing [MapPoint][3] software, which is targeted at marketing and business uses, as well as some low-end GIS uses.  Microsoft’s [Single View Platform][4] is targeted more to goverment applications.  Microsoft has [partnered with IDV Solutions][5] to make this application, so I expect some decent results.

I’m curious to see how this affects the government GIS applications market.
