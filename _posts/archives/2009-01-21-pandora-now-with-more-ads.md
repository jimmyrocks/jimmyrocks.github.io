[![Head On!][3]][3] 
Now that [Pandora][3] has been [becoming more popular][4], especially with their [iPhone ][5]application, they are thinking of ways to add more revenue to their model.  I guess you can’t blame them for trying to make money in [today’s economy][6]. Companies that have their main business model set around advertisements have been hurting for some time ([here][7] and [here][8]).[![You][10]][10]

In any case, they’re adding Ads to their radio stations!  Enjoy!

Also, do you think the people who titled the article linked below realized their misspelling of the word “ads” or did they do it as a lame attempt at a pun?  Because if it’s a pun, I applaud them!
