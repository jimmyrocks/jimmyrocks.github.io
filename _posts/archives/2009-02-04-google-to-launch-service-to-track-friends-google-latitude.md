Google must be getting tired of just tracking your searches and your emails and you calendar and you bookmarks and you documents and your….  anyway now they’re also [tracking your friends, in real time][2]!  It uses your phone’s GPS or cell phone tower triangulation to track your every step and store it indefinitely on Google’s massive servers for further market research.

I might want to upgrade my phone, because Sony Ericssons and Apple iPhones are still only marked as “coming soon”.  Here’s a list of support phones that I copied and pasted from Google’s site:

 
*   Android-powered devices, such as the T-Mobile G1
*   iPhone and iPod touch devices (coming soon)
*   most color BlackBerry devices
*   most Windows Mobile 5.0 devices
*   most Symbian S60 devices (Nokia smartphones)
*   many Java-enabled (J2ME) mobile phones, such as Sony Ericsson devices (coming soon)

I have a song in mind for this post, but I can seem to find a link to it, and god forbid I upload copyrighted music, so here’s an iTunes link to it:

The Pietasters – Ocean  [![The Pietasters - Willis - Ocean][5]][5]

Just on a note, this is the second song I’ ve linked called Ocean, and I am aware of other songs about stalking and Latitude, but this is the one I picked for this post.  Enjoy!
