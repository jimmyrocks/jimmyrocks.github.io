If it’s not too cloudy tonight, we should be able to see the Shuttle Launch!

> Weather permitting, people within about a 500-mile (800-kilometer) radius of the central Florida coast will be able to see the flare from the shuttle’s solid-fuel rocket launchers two seconds after launch for about two minutes.
> 
> From two to eight minutes after launch, *Discovery’*s main engines will make the shuttle seem to burn like a flickering, yellow-orange star.
> 
> People with binoculars may even be able to make out the shuttle’s V-shaped tail.
