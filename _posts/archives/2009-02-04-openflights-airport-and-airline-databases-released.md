I’m always on the lookout for new [GeoTagged][3] data, and it made my day I came across this database.  It contains almost all of the airports in the world, along with their positions in WGS84.

I’ve gone through their data a little bit, and it’s not 100% perfect.  There are no parameters to specify the type of airport (General Av., Heliport, Seaplane, etc) and some of the airports have ceased to exist since. (ie. Denver Stapleton Airport)

Despite its shortcomings, this is still a great chunk of geographic data.

Recently, a buddy of mine put together a map of the Major US airports on Google Maps, which can be found [here][4].  A lot of work was put into it to only include commercial airports and to specify the larger airports.  Its main intent is to aid travelers in finding the commercial airport nearest their destination.

It has inspired me to use the data from OpenFlights to create a maps of the World’s airports.  The resulting file was over 5mb, so I decided to create a subset of United States airports. So check out the [OpenFlights Airport Database – United States Airports on Google Maps][5].

As always, there is a song attached.  The flash player was giving me trouble, so here’s the mp3 straight up.
