There has been a lot of news this week centered around Depeche Mode.

Depeche Mode has recently announced [tour dates][2] for their 2009 album [Sounds Of The Universe][3].

I’ve also discovered that [Steve Pavlina][4], the writer of a very successful personal development blog must be a Depeche Mode fan himself.  He subtly hints to Depeche Mode in his [entry on the meaning of life][5].

So today’s big news is that Apple and Depeche Mode are teaming up to give users online access to new Depeche Mode videos and private releases as they become available for the next 15 weeks, for a (rather steep) price of $18.99.

This iTunes Pass will allow the users to download DM’s latest single ([Wrong][6]) as well as videos and exclusive music. They will also get the entire Sounds of The Universe album when it is released.

I was a sucker for the iTunes playing the Angel early release, which also came with a video for the song [Precious][7]. It seems that Apple and Depeche Mode have teamed up to figured out a good way to get my money this time!

To quote one of my favorite bands:

> They know my weaknesses  
> I never tried to hide them  
> They know my weaknesses  
> You tried them
