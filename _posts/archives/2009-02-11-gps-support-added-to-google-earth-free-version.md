I’ve been wanting to hook my GPS up to Google Maps for a while, and have always needed to boot into Windows to run MS Streets to track my position.  It appears that Google is finally allowing the free version of Google Earth to use a GPS.

This news has been overshadowed by bigger news, such as the Ocean Floor Mapping, and Historic Satellite Imagery, but it may be something I’m more likely to use on a regular basis!
