In my travels, I like to read the safety instructions for airplanes..

During my last round trip flights, I flew on four different aircraft:

*   [De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8-300][1]
*   [Embraer EMB E90 Jet][2]
*   [Boeing 737-500][3]
*   [Saab SF340A/B][4]

I have taken the time to photograph part of the safety instructions!  
Please excuse the color balance / graininess / lack of focus  
I used [my cell phone][5] to take these pictures.  I neglected to use my phone’s macro mode, and the auto white balance wasn’t working well, especially with the phone’s built in light.

Anyway, there are three things to be aware of when opening the emergency exit doors. This seems to vary by plane. I assume this has to do with the smaller planes have their exits over the wing, so the doors *should* be above the water line in the extremely unlikely event of the pilot properly [ditching][6] the plane.

The **De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8-300** suggests the passenger to be aware of: water, fire, and what appears to be an iceberg.

The **Embraer EMB E90 Jet** suggests the passenger to be aware of: smoke, red [kelp][9]? (possible underwater landing?), and Yellow Fire. Note, there is nothing mentioned about looking out for water.

They make sure to write it out in English and Spanish, so that 99% of the people in the United States can understand it. This is a small plane, and probably won’t fly internationally, except to Canada, which does have French speakers, and they didn’t put it in French on there. I’m sure most Francophones can understand the word debris, as it is a French word anyway, and fir and fire are close enough, smoke might cause a problem with the completely monolingual. Also, Quebec/Canada has some weird laws about what is required to be in French, so it may not be legal.

The people who created the book for the Saab SF340A/B had the right idea. They included words to describe the pictures. Apparently the unidentifiable object was debris. Meaning that it is probably not pointy smoke, or an iceberg. Kind of disappointing really! I’m not sure why the Embraer EMB E90 has yellow debris. The plane wasn’t yellow on the outside. I also don’t know why the fire looked a lot like red kelp. It may be a plot to intentionally confuse the passengers?

My conclusion (since I need one) is that, while a picture may be worth a thousand words, one word still may be more effective. This should be a well known fact, as the popular game [Pictionary][13] seems to be based on this principle.
