I’m not psychology expert, although I have taken three, yes three, undergraduate psychology classes… that means something, right? No? Hmm… in any case… I always thought the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was interesting at least for laughs.

I always loved how some tests would ask you questions, then dictate your answers back to you, as in the example below:

1.  Do you like cheese? (**Y** / N)
2.  Do you like ice cream? (**Y **/ N)
3.  Do you like cars? (**Y **/ N)
4.  Do you like trucks? (Y / **N**)
5.  Do you like birds? (Y / **N**)

Analysis:

 You enjoy dairy products of all kids, including the most sharp cheddar cheese and mild mozzarella, as well as both hard and soft ice creams. You are the type to enjoy long rides in the car. You would rather stay in a small vehicle, because you are uncomfortable being in or around large trucks for large amounts of time. You also would like to be far away from birds, because they cause you discomfort.

I know after reading that you probably think I’m a crazy nutjob, and you’re right. But what I’m trying to say is that a lot of these personality tests pretty much dictate back to you what you just told them, so it’s not really going to be very accurate at stereotyping you into neat little groups. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator tries to standardize everyone into 16 groups as showing in the table to the right.

I’m not going to completely plagiarize the information in Wikipedia, because you can easily click a link and read the article yourself:

I went though looking for a free test to see what I come up as, I didn’t go into any detail to retake tests or anything to get better results, but I came up with this one, and the results seemed to mirror reality, and they didn’t seem as canned as the ones in my example test.

The test I took can be found here:



My results can be found below:

Your 60.0% Extroverted and 40.0% Introverted

Your 15.0% Sensing and 85.0% Intuitive

Your 40.0% Thinking and 60.0% Feeling

Your 10.0% Judging and 90.0% Preceiving

The results from this test point that my category is: ENFP.

I’ve taken the liberty to highlight the glaring errors in this website’s spelling, to point out that this is just for fun. If you want a real personality test, they do have some ones you can pay for linked from the Wikipedia page. I would probably suggest asking a professional for better information, because I don’t believe that people can be squished into 16 different, yet distinct groups. Especially when you realize some of the results seem to be close to the determining line.

In any case, this is a fun test to play with to see what kind of stereotypes can be made about your personality based on input. It is also interesting to see what Wikipedia has to say about your personality. Unfortunately you probably can’t learn anything about yourself that you didn’t already know… but hey, this is just for fun! Enjoy!
