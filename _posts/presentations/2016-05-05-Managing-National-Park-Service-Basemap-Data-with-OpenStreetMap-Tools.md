NPMap builds tools and services to help national parks create beautiful digital maps. We use the OpenStreetMap model to create a dynamic cartographic database used to power custom National Park Service basemaps.

Our current technology backend is a PostGIS database in the OpenStreetMap schema. We use commercially supported FOSS tools from CartoDB and Mapbox to publish map products that combine official NPS data inside parks and OSM data outside of parks.

This session will focus on why we’ve chosen our current technology stack and highlight solutions we’ve developed so other projects can build on our successes in using existing open-source technology.
