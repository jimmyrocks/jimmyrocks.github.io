The United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Map Corps uses the OpenStreetMap editing platform to collect and manage points on their map. The project has recently expanded to 19 states, with plans to expand to the entire country by the end of the year. This presentation will discuss the project and the possibilities for importing the USGS crowdsourced data back in to OpenStreetMap.
