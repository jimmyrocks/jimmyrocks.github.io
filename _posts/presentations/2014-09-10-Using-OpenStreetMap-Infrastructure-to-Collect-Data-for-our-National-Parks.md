<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/106226068">Using OpenStreetMap Infrastructure to Collect Data for our National Parks â€” James McAndrew, National Park Service</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/openstreetmapus">OpenStreetMap US</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The National Park Service has many well-known sites, but many parks do not have the GIS resources to maintain their map data. The Places project aims to solve this problem by empowering non-technical park employees and the public with the ability to make changes to the map. The Places project uses custom versions of existing OpenStreetMap tools for data collection and uses them to create an up-to-date base map for National Park web sites. This presentation will discuss how we plan to motivate mappers, how we deal with data validation, and how we plan to continue working with OpenStreetMap.
