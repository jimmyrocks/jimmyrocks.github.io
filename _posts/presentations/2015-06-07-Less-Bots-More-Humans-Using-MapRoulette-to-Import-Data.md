Imports. The word strikes fear within the OpenStreetMap Community. New datasets may not be better than what is already in the map. Contributors may not want their edits erased by undiscerning merges.

Jim will discuss the problems with this process and how it can benefit OpenStreetMap as well as data providers such as the National Park Service.
