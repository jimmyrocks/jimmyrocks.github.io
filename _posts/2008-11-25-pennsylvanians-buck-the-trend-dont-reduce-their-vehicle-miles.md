[Pennsylvanians Buck the Trend, don’t reduce their Vehicle-Miles][1] 
Oddly enough, Pennsylvania seems to be roughly tied with North Dakota and Rhode Island for least drop in vehicle miles this year.

What are the reasons for this? Is it because SEPTA is so darn good that people have been using it all along, or because Pennsylvanians are just more stubborn than most people? Maybe it’s because public transportation if available to so few people that they really have no option.

I’m sure the people who believe the Poconos are a suburb of New York City are helping, as well as PA having the largest rural population, and a pretty dense road system.

The lighter colors of orange and yellow on the map shows states that have seen the greatest drops in vehicle-miles.
