[Global Map of Accessibility][1] 
**Travel time to major cities (in hours and days) and shipping lane density**

[![Global map of accessibility][3]][3]

> [A map released by the European Commission and the World Bank][1] models the accessibility (and isolation) of various parts of the world. It’s a heat map that shows the travel time to major cities (here defined as 50,000 or more people). The oceans show shipping lane density. Via [MAPS-L][3].

It’s interesting to note that only 10% of the earth is more than 2 day trip from a large city
