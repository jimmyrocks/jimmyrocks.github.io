I love heat maps, and I think [OpenStreetMap.org][1] is an amazing idea.  This is a heat map of the tile usage.  It’s cool to see bright spots in South America and Africa.  I’m curious as to why there isn’t a bright spot near Perth, and I guess I’ll need to sign in to get info on New Zealand, Eastern Australia, and Alaska. What’s with these maps that are always cutting on the [Water Hemisphere][4] anyway?
