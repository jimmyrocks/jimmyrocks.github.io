It looks like the person driving the [Google Car][3] accidentally hit a deer in upstate New York.  Google Street View has [removed the image][4] from Google Maps because of complaints.

The good news is that the Google car driver stopped the vehicle, and alerted the police, and by time the police had arrived, the deer had gotten up and ran away.  So the deer seems to have survived!
