So the [Ben Franklin Bridge][2] is awesome to bike over.  I did it not too long ago so I could explore Camden.  The people I met over there were all very nice, but I did meet a dog over there that probably was going to kill me.  Luckily its owner was able to restrain the beast from having me for dinner.

In any case, [Bike Week][3] (not [this Bike Week][4]) is next week, and they’re going to keep the bridge opened until 11pm! Just keep in mind that it’ll be dark, and there are parts of the walkway where you’re really not supposed to bike, and I can only imagine they’ll be more dangerous when you can’t see anything.
