    *   
*   All over the United States, starting at 10 Mountain time going until 4pm Mountain time, volunteers will be improving the US on OpenStreetMap.
*   You can join us in Denver, or at one of the [other locations across the country][1] or virtually on our IRC channel #osm-us on the irc.oftc.net network.

> **There is only one rule**: when you save your changes to OpenStreetMap, use #editathon in your commit message, we’ll use that to create a visulization of our edits afterwards.
