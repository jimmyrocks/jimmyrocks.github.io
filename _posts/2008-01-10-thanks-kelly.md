Kelly wanted to hear more of my random ramblings… So thank her for this post!

Today has been a great day of sorts.

I discovered this website:



It’s run by comcast, so it’s fast, legal, and free.. and rather low quality

but I did get my Weird Science fill.. I remember watching that show before Duckman, back in whatever day that was!

I’ve been trying to get more into concert photography. I am hoping to get my dSLR into some shows and eventually upgrade lenses… This will be a topic later, so keep posted! I’m planning on seeing Big D at the TLA on Saturday, I’m going to try to get my Nikon Coolpix 5200 in and get some photos! If anyone has suggestions on who to talk to at the TLA or in the bands to get a camera in, please get back to me!

I’ve created a very good Vegan Oatmeal Apple Cinnamon Cookie recipe, and have made about 50 cookies. The first batch includes Jones Cream Soda, as well as a good amount of Ginger flavoring. The second batch has much less sugar, and less ginger, but more banana. I used Cripps Pink apples, which was definitely a good choice. I could go into my specifics for making the recipe, as they are probably interesting to some people, but the recipe will stay secret, at least until I debut the cookies! I plan on using these delicious treats at two parties.. The first party includes pirogies from a Russian Orthodox church, the second party is held for the benefit of my good friend Kelly, who is also the reason why I am posting again!

Kelly will be on TV Friday at 9 and 11pm, and again on Saturday at some point. She was involved in the TV show “What Not To Wear”.. her Facebook note can be read (by some) here: [http://drexel.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=6867408121&ref=nf][3]

For this airing, I plan to be there, and bring my cookies!

I’ve also been getting more into whiskey as of recently. I’ve long been a fan of Johnny Walker black, as you may have read from previous posts. I have been doing some research, and have figured out that my favorite flavor in whiskey comes from the oak barrels, specifically Vanillin and quercus lactone. Which kind of tastes coconutty.. In any case, I decided to get some Jim Beam Black, I like wasting $20 / bottle on crap I’m not sure I’ll like.. I don’t know if I like the Bourbon taste as much as the milder Scotch taste, but I do notice a much stronger oak flavor, which I really like. I’m beginning to think I like whiskey for the same reason I like tea, because it brings out the subtle esters found in plants that are very unique and well rounded.

Also, I’ve been torn on what my song of the day should be.. I’ve been getting into the new(ish) InSoc CD, and I’ve been trying to get into the Arcade Fire CD with some success. I love some of the songs off the new New Pornographers CD which I’d love to showcase, but the more I listen to the Editors, the more I like their debut single “Munich” it came out in 2005, and I didn’t think much of it, but for various reasons it has come up in my playlist a few times, and I’ve really come to love the song.

(the band doesn’t want people embedding their video, so you’ll have to deal with a link)

Sadly, I am not planning on attending the YRock on XPN Freezetival, which will have the editors and Hot Hot Heat, two bands that I really like. This is mostly because I just don’t like Electric Factory shows that much, and also, it is conflicting with an XPN show of Marshall Crenshaw, another artist I really like. Why must XPN do this to me, and offer two great shows on the same night! I am a proud XPN supporter, and member, and suggest you do the same, cause they do a heck of a lot for the music of Philadelphia. I’m looking forward to the English Beat show at the Troc, although it’s on a Thursday and I probably won’t be able to go, I see Robert Drake is somehow on the lineup as a DJ, and he has excellent taste in music. Maybe I will make it out next Friday.. TIME WILL TELL!!!

I’m also excited for Friday night, because I am planning on going to the M-room featuring DJ Deejay presents: Friday I’m in Love. If you know me at all you’ll know my favorite bands include Depeche Mode (and Vince Clark bands Erasure, Yaz), New Order & Joy Division, The Smith & Morrissey, and that whole Genre.. and this M-room thing sound like it’s amazingly up my want to be a goth alley! I’ve very excited!!!!
