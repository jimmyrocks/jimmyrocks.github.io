It looks like Circuit City’s going to be closing down all of their stores, and sending ~35,000 people to the unemployment lines.  The only ray of hope is if someone decides to buy them out… and that’s not looking likely right now.

Despite this being horrible news, there should be some good deals coming from Circuit City in the future, so keep an eye out!

 has been suggested as a place to look for deals.
