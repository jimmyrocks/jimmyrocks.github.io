**The Scotch:**  
Around 6ish tonight, I decided I’d embark on my adventure to purchase [Diageo][1] products. One of my good friends, Sheila, has some sort of deal where she can get me a discount on these products for this week only.

With this in mind, I had my parents pick up a case of [Guinness][2], I know they like the drink, and this discount thing is sweet. I decided for myself I would have to pick up some [Baileys Irish Cream][3] and [Johnnie Walker][4] Black. So far, it seems like a good choice.

**Pretzels:**  
So I realized as I was driving down the PA turnpike that I was rather low on gas, with this, I thought about the gas stations that are on my way. My route is mostly made up of highways, and I wouldn’t have encountered a gas station until I hit Ridge Ave.

I decided to get off at the Fort Washington exit, and head toward Bethlehem Pike. I passed two Lukoil stations, but since they required left turns, I decided I’d keep heading forward. I recognized the area, as I have biked it once before. With this memory, I also remembered that there would not be any gas stations until I entered Flourtown. With my gas light already on for a while, this began to concern me, so I decided, the next gas station I see, be it on the right or the left, I will stop and get gas.

So I enter Flourtown, and see a BP on the left, but since I’m a weird person, I decide to make a right turn and take a U turn on that road. As I turned right, I realized there was a Texaco across the street from the BP, but it was too late, I had my heart set on the $2.73/gal BP. I took the U-Turn, and pondered the possibility of visiting Texaco (also $2.73/gal) instead on BP, thoughts raced through my head as to which company more closely fits my political views. Then I realized this was stupid, and no matter what the brand, the gas is probably all from the same sources. So, yeah I got gas at the BP.

Lucky for me, the BP was in the Acme shopping center. I decided to stop in, and purchase a card for my soon to be former boss. His wife just gave birth to a baby boy! So I feel that I would like to congratulate him, and a card is more formal than the standard email. I picked a card, and was on my way. The one issue here is my love for food, I felt compelled to walk around and look for a snack that I’ve never had, that would open my taste buds, while being absolutely delicious. I saw “Utz Toasted Sesame Pretzels” and instantly fell in love!

**Femmes:**  
Back in June of 2006, I was hanging out with some of my best friends from Drexel University, Ken and Kelly, and we stopped by the now defunct [Tower Records][7] on [Broad Street][8]. For some reason or another, they had the [Violent Femmes][9]’ [self-titled album][10] on sale, and I decided that I required it to be in my collection. I also picked up the [Devo][11] Album “[Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!][12]” on this trip. I have already owned the Violent Femmes compilation “[Add It Up (1981-1993)][13]” for many years, and I have loved it. I realize that there is something much more coherent with the album that just a compilation of excellent songs. I got into the self-titled Femmes album over the summer, and have been revisiting it every once in a while. It was well worth the investment.

One quite memorable trivial piece of information about this album involves one of my favorites TV shows, “[How I Met Your Mother][14]”. If you’re a devout fan, such as I am; you would know that Marshall and Lily’s song is “[Good Feeling][15]” by The Violent Femmes. I must say, of the not-so-popular tracks, my favorite song is currently “[Please Do Not Go][16]”.

Another thing about this album that angers me, is the usage of the song “[Blister In The Sun][17]” being currently used in a Wendy’s commercial. ([More Discussed Here][18]) I think the only commercial I’ve seen with worse song placement was the car commercial using [Smash Mouth][19]’s “[Walking On The Sun][20]” as its background music. They carefully edited out the second line of the chorus to completely change the meaning of the song.

From:

> So don’t delay, act now, supplies are running out  
> Allow, if you’re still alive, six to eight years to arrive

To:

> So don’t delay, act now, supplies are running out

Smash Mouth had quickly sold out, and now their follow up album was not nearly as good (in my opinion) as “[Fush Yu Mang][21]”, and with the combination of this commercial and their music in Shrek, I knew it was time to give up listening to Smash Mouth. I still love to play “[Padrino][22]” on my guitar, and will have fond memories of attempts of covering some of their songs with various people.

**The Culmination:**  
After a delicious dinner of spaghetti and meatballs with sausage, I decided to retreat to my room. I checked email, and some other things, and talked to my good friend Ken on the phone for a little while. I decided to open up my newly acquired scotch and pretzels. I decided the Violent Femmes CD would put me in the proper mood to relax, and reflex upon my day. It has put me in a great mood, and makes me excited that I only have 6 more working days before I head to Argentina! I also suggest to anyone to try to have a night of good music, good drinks, and a good snack… It will make you feel better.
