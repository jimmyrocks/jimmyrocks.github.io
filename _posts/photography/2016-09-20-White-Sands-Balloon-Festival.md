<p>Since I was already in New Mexico to present at AutoCarto 2016, we decided to take a trip to White Sands National Monument for the 24th Annual White Sands Balloon Invitational. The White Sands is an amazing place for a hot air balloon launch. I imaging that the views from the balloons are amazing as well.</p>
