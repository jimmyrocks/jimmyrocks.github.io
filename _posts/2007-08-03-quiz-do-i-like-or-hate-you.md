For every question you answer ‘yes’, you get one point:

1. Are you from New Jersey?

2. Do you own a Motor Home?

3. Did you hit a piece of wood, having it fly into my car damaging both the windshield and the passenger’s side window, along with the A pillar?

If you scored 3, I hate you

If you scored less than 3, I may not hate you.

Bonus Questions:

Does your license plate end with NX68G?

Are you a member of the Family Motor Coach Association?
