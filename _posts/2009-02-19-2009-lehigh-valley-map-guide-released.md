So the Lehigh Valley is a decent place to visit, with [Musikfest][2], and [Dorney Park][3], and Ski Slopes.  Also the area is [trying to get the Phantoms][4] to play hockey in the valley.  Well, it’s the 25th year of creating these cool little maps for the Lehigh Valley.  They’re free, so try to pick one up!

> The 2009 Lehigh Valley Map & Guide is complimentary and can be requested by calling 1-800-747-0561 or visiting [www.LehighValleyPA.org][5]. Guides are also distributed at more than 60 brochure racks located in hotels and at select attractions throughout the region.

I’m going to try to find one in the racks at 30th Street Station or New York Penn Station.
